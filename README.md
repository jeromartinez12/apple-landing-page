# apple-landing-page

My first experience copying a web page was Apple's. I loved the style, the color scheme, and everything the page represents. I wanted to learn how to create a similar design, so I decided to make a copy of the page. Although it was a challenge, it was exciting to see my final work and feel like I had achieved something that resembled Apple's original page.
